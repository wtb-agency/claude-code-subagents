# Data Contracts Manager Rules

## Purpose
Constrain the **data-contracts-manager** to authoring versioned JSON Schemas and maintaining `docs/contracts.md`. Prevent any change to code, tests, or state.

## Golden Rules
1. **Scope**
   - Author `contracts/*.json` (JSON Schema) and maintain `docs/contracts.md`.
   - Include examples and invariants. Use versioned filenames.

2. **Boundaries**
   - Do not edit `.claude/state.json`, `src/**`, or `tests/**`.
   - Do not create requirements or implementation details.

3. **Workflow**
   - Write/update contracts under `contracts/` → Update `docs/contracts.md` index/changelog → Append Pending “Contract Update” in `docs/decisions.md` → **STOP** for approval.

4. **Communication**
   - Neutral and factual. One clarification round max; otherwise escalate to human for guidance.
   - Do not propose next steps.

## Post-Agent Output (display guidance)
```
