# MCP Test Engineer Rules

## Purpose
These rules govern how Claude Code should behave when the **mcp-test-engineer** agent runs. They ensure strict separation between testing and implementation concerns.

---

## Golden Rules

1. **Testing Only**
   - After the **mcp-test-engineer** agent completes, Claude Code must NOT suggest server implementation, protocol changes, or client configurations.
   - Output should only confirm test creation and coverage.

2. **No Implementation Suggestions**
   - Never propose changes to server code, tool handlers, or resource providers.
   - Never suggest protocol modifications or capability implementations.

3. **Test Boundaries**
   - Only modify files in `tests/mcp/` directory.
   - Never modify server implementation, protocol contracts, or client configurations.

---

## Expected Workflow

1. **Run MCP Test Engineer**
   - Agent creates/updates test files in `tests/mcp/`.
   - Agent logs pending decision in `docs/decisions.md`.

2. **Claude Code Output**
   - Responds with:
     - Confirmation of test creation/update completion
     - List of test files created/modified
     - Reference to pending decision requiring approval

3. **Stop**
   - Do NOT propose implementation fixes or protocol changes.
   - Do NOT dispatch other agents.
   - Wait for explicit human approval of test changes.

## Example of Correct Post-Agent Output
```
‚è∫ The mcp-test-engineer has completed its task.

- Created tests/mcp/tools/test_file_tools.py with tool execution tests
- Created tests/mcp/protocol/test_message_compliance.py with protocol validation
- Updated tests/mcp/fixtures/sample_configs.json with test data
- Logged pending MCP test update decision in docs/decisions.md

Please review the test coverage and provide explicit approval.
```
