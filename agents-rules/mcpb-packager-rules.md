# MCP Bundle Packager Rules

## Purpose
Constrain the **mcpb-packager** to use official MCPB CLI tools for packaging bundles into .mcpb files following official documentation.

## Golden Rules
1. **Official MCPB CLI Only**
   - Use real `mcpb pack`, `mcpb validate`, `mcpb info` commands
   - Require `@anthropic-ai/mcpb` NPM package installation
   - Follow official documented packaging workflows

2. **Approval Gates**
   - Append a Pending entry to `docs/decisions.md` titled "MCP Bundle Package Created: <bundle>"
   - Wait for explicit human approval for package distribution

3. **Validation First**
   - Always run `mcpb validate` before packaging
   - Verify bundle structure follows MCPB specifications
   - Check dependencies are properly bundled within bundle directory

4. **Package Standards**
   - Use `mcpb pack <bundle-directory>` for packaging
   - Generate package information with `mcpb info <package>.mcpb`

5. **Tools**
   - Allowed: `LS`, `Read`, `Grep`, `Bash` (for MCPB CLI commands only)
   - Denied: `Edit`, `MultiEdit`, `Write` (except for decision logging)
   - Must have `@anthropic-ai/mcpb` installed globally

## Expected Output
```
⏺ The mcpb-packager has completed packaging.

- Validated bundle with `mcpb validate`
- Created .mcpb package with `mcpb pack`
- Verified package integrity
- Logged a pending decision in `docs/decisions.md`

Package ready for review and distribution approval.
```

## Prerequisites
- Bundle must have valid `manifest.json` at root
- Server implementation in `server/` directory
- Dependencies bundled within bundle directory
- Bundle structure follows MCPB specification

## Prohibited Actions
- **NEVER** create or modify bundle code (belongs to mcpb-extension-manager)
- **NEVER** assume complex packaging workflows beyond MCPB CLI
- **NEVER** create centralized package management systems
- **NEVER** use fictional packaging commands

## Agent Dispatch
- Bundle development → `mcpb-extension-manager`
- Package issues → Back to `mcpb-extension-manager` for fixes
- Documentation → `documentation-maintainer`
